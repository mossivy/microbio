# Genetics of Bacteria

### Terms 
* Genotype: sequence of nucleotides in DNA
* Phenotype: observed characteristics of cell
* Plasmid: DNA that replicates independently of chromosome

### Gene Changes in Bacteria  

Horizonatal Gene Transfer
    DNA from one bacteria to another 
    1. Transformation: bacteria die and DNA absorbed by living bacteria 
    2. Conjugation: plasmid transfers to other bacteria
    3. Transduction: DNA is transfered by virus 


## Transduction
    -   DNA transfered between bacteria via bacteriophage
    -   **Lysogenic** cycle
            virus DNA incorporated into the bacteria's own DNA 
    -   **Lytic** Cycle
            virus created inside bacteria and then bursts out

## Conjugation
    -   Plasmids: contains F plasmid --> F+ ... does not contain --> F-
    -   In E. coli **F plasmid encode proteins required for conjugation including sex pilus** 
        -   Donor F+ can transfer DNA to F-i
    
### Transposons
    *Jumping DNA*
    small segments of DNA that move from one region of a DNA molecule to another
    can inactivate genes
    causes mutations
    can be transfered in plasmids
