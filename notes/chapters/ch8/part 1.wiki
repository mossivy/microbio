= Genetics of Bacteria =

== Terms ==
  * Genotype: sequence of nucleotides in DNA
  * Phenotype: observed characteristics of cell
  * Plasmid: DNA that replicates independently of chromosome
  * Transduction
  * Conjugation
  * Transformation

== Gene Changes in Bacteria ==

=== Horizontal Gene Transfer ===
DNA from one bacteria to another:  
  1. Transformation: bacteria die and DNA absorbed by living bacteria  
  2. Conjugation: plasmid transfers to other bacteria  
  3. Transduction: DNA is transferred by virus

== Transduction ==
  - DNA transferred between bacteria via bacteriophage  
  - **Lysogenic** cycle: virus DNA incorporated into the bacteria's own DNA  
  - **Lytic** cycle: virus created inside bacteria and then bursts out

== Conjugation ==
  - Plasmids: contains F plasmid → F+; does not contain → F-  
  - In *E. coli*, **F plasmid encodes proteins required for conjugation including sex pilus**  
    - Donor F+ can transfer DNA to F-

=== Transposons ===
Jumping DNA:  
  - Small segments of DNA that move from one region of a DNA molecule to another  
  - Can inactivate genes  
  - Causes mutations  
  - Can be transferred in plasmids
