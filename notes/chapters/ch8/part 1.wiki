== Gene Changes in Bacteria ==

=== [[../../topics/vertical_gene_transfer|Vertical Gene Transfer]] ===
DNA passed from one bacteria generation to the Next

=== [[../../topics/horizontal_gene_transfer|Horizontal Gene Transfer]] ===
DNA from one bacteria to another:  
  1. Transformation: bacteria die and DNA absorbed by living bacteria  
  2. Conjugation: [[../../topics/plasmid|plasmid]] transfers to other bacteria  
  3. Transduction: DNA is transferred by virus

== Transduction ==
  - DNA transferred between bacteria via bacteriophage  
  - [[../../topics/lysogenic cycle|Lysogenic cycle]]: virus DNA incorporated into the bacteria's own DNA  
  - [[../../topics/lytic_cycle|Lytic cycle]]: virus created inside bacteria and then bursts out

== Conjugation ==
  - Plasmids: contains F plasmid → F+; does not contain → F-  
  - In *E. coli*, F plasmid encodes proteins required for conjugation including sex pilus
    - Donor F+ can transfer DNA to F-

== Transposon ==
Jumping DNA:  
  - Small segments of DNA that move from one region of a DNA molecule to another  
  - Can inactivate genes  
  - Causes mutations  
  - Can be transferred in plasmids
