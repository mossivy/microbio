*Vector* organisms that transmits other organisms(parasites)
Viruse:s: yellow fever
Bacteria: Borrelia burgdorfer

=== Protozoa ===
IE: Plasmodium

    unicellular
    no cell wall
    motile via cilia flagella or pseudopods
        - EXCEPT apicomplexans
        - Flagella
            - w/ mitochondria
            - w/o mitochondria
     
    organelles & vacules
    reproduction: budding, fission 
    trophozite(active) & cysts(resistant and dormant)
    complex lifestyle: sexual, asexual, binary fission, multiple fission ( [[../../topics/shizogony|shizogony]] )

    Distribution
        moist environment: ponds, streams, lakes, oceans
        very few are pathogens

    Giardia lamblia --> Giardiasis -->  diarrhea
        flagella, unicellular
        - fecal-oral transmission: contaminated water
        - cysts present in feces
        - greasy diarrhea due to fat interference
 
    *Trichomonas* vaginalis --> Trichomoniasis
        - trophozite
        - most infection in *women*; woman symptomatic, men asymptomatic
     
     Toxoplasma gondii --> Toxoplasmosis
        transmission
            - eating uncooked meat
            - ingestion of cat feces
        healthy: no or mild symptoms
        problematic:
            - immunocomprimised
            - pregnant woman: congenital birth defects
    *Trypanosoma* brucei --> Trypanosomiasis
        - African Sleeping Sickness
        - spread fly bite
        - infects central nervous system
        - triggers immune system
        - flagellated
    
    Entamoeba histolytica --> *Amebiasis* 
        only pathogenic amoeba found in human intestines ( GI system)
        bloody diarrhea

    Plasmodium vivac --> *Maleria*
       vector mosquito & blood transfer
       live in red blood cell
       
    Balantidium Coli
        GI System
        bloody diarrhea
        only cilliated protist that is pathogenic in humans
        
=== Fungi ===
Mycologist study fungi
heterotrophic
Cell Wall: Chitin, polysaccarchide
Mold & Yeast
    1. mold: aerobic
    2. yeast: faculative anaerobes
prefer to live in pH of 5.0
thallus: non-reproductive structure
fruting body: reproductive stucture    
    Yeast
        Budding -- form of mitosis

    * Superficial
        * IE: Jock Itch, Athlete's foot, [[../../topics/ringworm|Ringworm]]
        * Keratinase - breaks down keratin
    * Subcutaneous
        * Sporotrichosis 
    * Systematic
        * *Pneumocystosis* (pneumonia)
            * mostly seen in AIDS patients   
        * *Cryptococcus*
            * effects nervous system 
            * mostly AIDS patients opportunistic meningitis 
    
    Systemic Mycoses: mainly effect immunocomprimised 
    
    Candidiasis: Opprotunistic
        mouth, digestive tract, vagina
        white plaque in mouth (*Thrush*), diaper rash, vaginitis
        suseptable: certain immunocomprimised & antibiotic overdoes
=== Helminth ===
