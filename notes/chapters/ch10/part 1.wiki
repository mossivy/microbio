*Genus*  
  related species  

*Species*  
  group of strains  

*Strain*  
  population in species that have distinct genes/phenotype  

Bacteria *don't* have histones but Archaea and Eukarya do

== David Bergey ==
- description for all 'known species'  
- classification from *Phenotype*  
- later changed to *Genotype*  

== Microscope ID ==
- determine size, shape, and stain colors  
- Can sometimes determine pathogen from context + Microscope ID:  
  - *Streptococcus* in respiratory system if clusters of circles G+  
  - *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* if genitals, diplococcus G-  

== Culture Characteristics ==
- Pigment:  
  - *Serratia marcescens* colonies red at 22°C but white at 35°C  
  - *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* produces green pigment & fruity odor  
  - *E. coli* UTI ferments lactose, pink colonies on MacConkey agar  
- Differential Media aids in Identification:  
  - *Streptococcus pylogenes* (strep throat) yields β-hemolysis on blood agar  

== Isolation & Identification ==
- streak a culture plate  
- take a sample, streak on agar, incubate at 37°C for >24 hrs  

= Biochemical Tests =
- Metabolic capabilities  
- Catalase test: positive if O₂ bubbles after H₂O₂ is added to colony  
- Many tests use pH indicators  

= Antibiotic Resistance =
- Antibiograms reveal differences in susceptibility to antimicrobial medicines
