# Identification & Classification

1. Domain
2. Kingdom
3. Phylum
4. Class
5. Order
6. Family
7. Genus
8. Species
9. Subspecies
10. Strain
    
**Genus**
    related species
**Species**
    group of strains
**Strain**
    population in species that have distinct genes/phenotype
    
Bacteria **don't** have *histones* but Archaea and Eukarya do

**David Bergey**
    - description for all 'known species'
    - classification from **Phenotype** 
    - later changed to **Genotype**

Microscope ID
    determine size, shape, and stain colors
    Can sometime determine pathogen from context+MicroscopeID
        **Streptococcus** in respitory system if clusters of circles G+
        **Neisseria Gonorrhoeae** IFF genitals in Diplococcus G-

##Culture Characteristics
- Pigment
    - **Serratia marcescens** colonies red at 22C but white at 35C
    - **Pseudomonas aeruginosa** produces green pigment & fruity odor
    - **E. coli** UTI ferments lactose, pink colonies on MacConkey
Differential Media aids in Identification
    - **Streptococcus pyogenes strep throat** yields Î²- on blood agar

Isolation & Identification
    streak a culture plate
    take a sample. streak on agar. incubate at 37C for >24hrs
    
#Biochemical Tests
    - Metabolic Capabilites 
    - Catalyse tests: positive if O2 bubbles after H2O2 is added to colony
    - Many tests us pH 

Antibiotic Resistance
    Antibiograms reveal differences in susceptibility to antimicrobial medicines
