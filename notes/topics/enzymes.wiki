Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in living organisms without being consumed in the process.

== Structure and Function ==
- Most enzymes are proteins.
- They have an active site where substrates bind.
- Enzyme activity depends on factors like temperature, pH, and substrate concentration.

== Mechanism ==
- Lower activation energy of reactions.
- Bind substrates to form enzyme-substrate complex.
- Convert substrates into products and release them.

== Types of Enzymes ==
- **Oxidoreductases:** catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions.
- **Transferases:** transfer functional groups between molecules.
- **Hydrolases:** catalyze hydrolysis reactions.
- **Lyases:** add or remove groups to form double bonds. Ch. 4, Ch. 5
- **Isomerases:** catalyze isomerization changes.
- **Ligases:** join two molecules using ATP.

== Importance ==
- Vital for metabolism.
- Used in biotechnology and medicine (e.g., enzyme replacement therapy).
