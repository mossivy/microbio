= Peptide bond =

A peptide bond is a covalent bond formed between the amino group of one amino acid and the carboxyl group of another, releasing a molecule of water (condensation reaction).
It links amino acids together in proteins, forming the protein’s backbone.

== Key points ==
- Has partial double-bond character, making it planar and rigid.
- Formation occurs during protein synthesis (translation).
